Tailwind CSS Tutorial Project
This project is based on a tutorial I followed to learn Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It showcases a simple layout with concentric circles using Tailwind's utility classes for styling.

In this project, I practiced using Tailwind CSS to style HTML elements. The layout consists of three nested sections, each styled with different background colors, shadows, and rounded borders to create a layered, circular design.
